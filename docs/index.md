# Almalexia Discord Bot

The Almalexia Discord Bot is a simple event and signup manager for Discord. It is not intended for wide usage, but only my personal guilds, as we have very specific ideas how our events are set up. If you are interested in the code, just open an issue, I will gladly provide access it (and later once it is stable, generally public) so that you can host your own instance for your servers.

## Documentation

## What it does

It will create event posts and update it with user signups, here an example:
