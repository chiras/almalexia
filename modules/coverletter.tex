I am writing in response to your advertisement for the  "{\positiontitle}" %position
as listed on {\referral}. Currently, I am senior research group leader at the University of Würzburg\iftoggle{notgerman}{, Germany.}{.} I am keen to progress to the next step in my career at an excellent  institution with a strong profile in the areas of {\universitystrengths}. The {\universitylong} is a perfect fit for  my criteria,
%and I am particularly intrigued by new opportunities arising with establishment of a new campus.
%for my research through frameworks like the Synthetic Biology cluster.
which is why
the advertised position appeals to me so strongly. I am confident that I can enrich the {\faculty} in many ways.

I am fascinated by the driving forces behind biodiversity, and its taxonomic and genomic composition, evolution and complex interactions at different scales. I am further commited to its conservation, biomonitoring and protection. %To research this,
 My main research theme is the plant-microbe- pollinator triangle, investigating ecology and evolution of these bipartite and tripartite interactions and their responses to anthropogenic changes. Secondly, I am interested in the co-evolution of microbiomes with carnivorous plants. I am keen to combine ecological, computational and molecular methods %established biodiversity genomics at my current institution
  and thus developed relevant laboratory and bioinformatics tools to pursue my goals (e.g.~pioneering plant metabarcoding). Further, I value and actively support open-science principles. Beside these main topics, I am involved in diverse  collaborations regarding other organismic interactions, e.g.~on rhizosphere bacteria in tropical peat-swamp forests, plant root competition and the pathobiome of grapevine galls.

I (co-)authored {\papernumber} peer-reviewed research articles and two reviews in recognised quality journals, and a further {\papernumberunpub} manuscripts are in the process of publication. I am internationally connected and regularly participate in editorial activities.
I have acquired research grants from different German funding agencies, totalling \EUR{\fundingvalue} in addition to \EUR{\cofundingvalue} for collaborators. I am part of two coordinated research programs (SPPs), another is recommended for funding (EU Biodiversa). I am currently in the process of applying for further collaborative funding (GRK, FOR).

Since 2004, I have participated in, coordinated and developed classes in molecular ecology as well as computational biology, ranging from first semester bachelor degrees to doctoral students. I have supervised six doctoral candidates and six further are currently conducting their studies, further {\supermsc} Master of Science and {\superbsc} Bachelor of Science theses. I hosted a highly demanded international workshop with participants from 12 different countries. Currently, I am heavily involved in all aspects of curriculum development in our recently established Centre for Computational and Theoretical Biology.
I am part of several faculty and university committees, contributing to the development of research and teaching.
%I am known as a fair, collaborative and ethical academic, with integrity and a commitment to transparent decision-making.

The {\faculty} at the {\universitylong} hosts many activities closely related to my own interests; I am excited and enthusiastic about the numerous potential opportunities for new and ongoing collaborative endeavours with a variety of people. This position complements my research interests and professional ambitions, and I am certain that I could make a valuable and ongoing contribution to the important work of the {\universityshort}.

Thank you for your consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my application in greater detail.

%I am writing in response to your advertisement for a position as
%%tenure track Assistant Professor position in Quantitative Ecology or Evolution of Microbes
%Associate Professor / Professor in Biodiversity Genomics, as listed at
%NatureJobs.
%Currently, I am a research group leader at the University of Würzburg and seek my future challenges as a
%Biodiversity Genomicist
%% ecological bioinformatician
%% molecular ecologist
%at an excellent institution with a strong research and teaching profile in the area of
%% ecology
%biodiversity research, evolutionary biology and genomics, ideally in a country with diverse and rich natural environments. The advertised position presents a perfect opportunity to pursue my future goals and has thus sparked my interest. %Thus, I respectfully submit this letter of application.
%
%I am fascinated by the driving forces behind taxonomic and genomic biodiversity, and its composition, evolution and resilience within complex ecological interactions. Further, I engage into the active development of laboratory and bioinformatics tools in (meta-)genomics. The
%%UCLA
%University of Western Australia
%hosts many research activities closely related to my own interests so that I am convinced that my research and teaching is well integrable and provides new opportunities for collaborations with a variety of faculty researchers.
%
%Directly after my PhD in Bioinformatics, I gained the opportunity to initiate an independent research group in Würzburg. I established the infrastructure for molecular ecological research using high-throughput sequencing, a \textit{hitherto} novel research area at the university. This workgroup is now a flourishing research environment, where Master, Bachelor and Doctoral students accomplish their projects. We are very effective in terms of teaching, method development, grant acquisition, collaboration as well as publication of our research.
%%I recently completed my habilitation (higher PhD) with focus on the integration of high-throughput sequencing and genomics into ecological research.
%
%This exceptional opportunity of establishing a novel research group has shown me the challenges of a career in academia that include acquisition, setup and management of human and financial resources, but especially to foster scientific knowledge, collaboration and creativity. With this experience I am intrigued to apply for your advertised
%%permanent
%tenurable
%position as a professor.
%
%Last year, I was hosted at two Australian Universities (University of the Sunshine Coast, University of New England), and enjoyed the formidable and welcoming social, teaching and research environments experienced during my visits. My family and me thus sincerely consider moving our center of life to Australia. I will thus largely appreciate if my application turns out to be successful. I thank you for considering me and look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications.
